      <h3>Q&A Response</h3>
      <p>Will major corporations adopt ethical AI practices, and is it imperative to strengthen regulations for compliance? 


This question arose during the Q&A.


In response, I drew parallels to the rise of sustainability two decades ago when its universal adoption wasn't foreseeable. Similarly, the ethical use of Artificial Intelligence is progressing, and while regulations play a vital role, genuine change requires individuals and corporations to willingly embrace better AI practices without external pressure.


🎙️During my keynote at DevCon in Bucharest, I delved into the methods of mitigating algorithmic bias in datasets when training AI models and the strategies to implement ethical principles throughout the entire development lifecycle, including data collection, algorithm processing, and AI deployment.


📈 I was truly impressed by the large audience at the two-day event. Deepest appreciation to the entire DevCon team for making it all possible in Bucharest, Romania. 

It was indeed outstanding at DevTalksRomania !</p>

      <h3>Keynote</h3>
      <p>Who is defeating us with AI ? Is it the machines themselves, or are we: engineers, creators or culprits?


This dilemma raises ethical issues.


The data we input into AI models is often biased. Consider the scenario of teaching a robot to make decisions; if it learns from a single source with one perspective, it may develop a limited understanding of how things work. This is the consequence of training AI models with non-diverse information.


To address this issue, we should ensure that, data we use is a fair representation of all individuals, encompassing various identities and backgrounds. This approach can enable AI to learn and apply algorithmic fairness.


Transparency should serve as the guiding principle, providing a clear path to trace the journey of data, understanding its origins, the alterations it undergoes, and its evolution over time. 


And when gathering data from various sources, it's crucial to keep users informed about the collection process and have clear options to consent or opt out. This commitment to privacy should extend from the initial data collection stage through to the point where AI algorithms process the information and make decisions based on it.


Data security is a collective duty. We need to develop and deploy our AI technologies with security to prevent unwanted manipulations and activities that might cause breaches.


Let us strive to create technology all the while recognizing our shared responsibility, ensuring that none of the principles of AI ethics are compromised.


I had the honor of delivering this keynote where I emphasized the significance of AI ethics and the necessity of harnessing the full potential of AI at TechBBQ, the largest tech event in the Nordics, that was held in Copenhagen.</p>

      <p>✨ Gen AI Summit EU was enriching !

The summit focused on the transformative power of Generative AI, its practical applications, and ethics.


It was a great honor to be the Master of Ceremonies for two days at Gen AI Summit EU, which took place in Valencia. 


Special thanks to the organizer Julieta Zalduendo for bringing together distinguished experts who are shaping the future of technology.


Muchas gracias Julieta por esta experiencia inolvidable! Fue un honor formar parte de este evento tan especial, lleno de inspiración!</p>
