      <!-- About Section -->
      <h2>AI Expert | Software Engineer<br>Ethical AI Trainer | Keynote Speaker</h2>
      <p>
        I am a founder of <a href="https://emeaventure.com/" target="_blank">EMEA Venture Builder</a> and NEEMA AI, and a passionate advocate for Artificial Intelligence Ethics, AI that is fair, transparent, and inclusive. My background include software engineering, data science, full-stack web development, and economics.
        At EMEA Venture Builder, we develop personalized AI-driven software for businesses ranging from task automation, predictive analytics, LLM-powered solutions to custom data intelligence platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through NEEMA AI, I deliver specialized training in AI ethics for organizations and individuals in areas such as algorithmic fairness, data privacy, security, accountability, reliability, and AI governance. I help organizations design and implement responsible AI that aligns with core human values and legal standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a keynote speaker and Master of Ceremonies, I engage global audiences with thought-provoking talks on ethical AI. My talks emphasize the urgent need for responsibility in innovation, social impact of machine learning, and the importance of building AI that serves everyone equally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Academically, I hold two Master’s degrees: an MSc in Business and Research from University of Barcelona (Spain), and an MSc in Economy and Management from University of Annecy (France), along with diplomas in Data Science and Full-Stack Web Development.
        In 2022, I was nominated as an Ambassador of Barcelona by the City Council, and in 2024, I received the honorary Tech Leader of the Year award from Women Who Change the World.
